Week 1:
Had our first group meeting where we introduced ourselves and chose Theon to be the scrum master.

Week 2:
Started the first sprint (week end):
I worked on the System Architecture diagram and came up with a rough draft on draw.io

Week 3:
Started second sprint (week end):
I redesigned the System Architecture diagram to have a lot more depth and with help
from Matt wrote up a description of the SA diagram.
I attempted to integrate a BE endpoint for the dashboard. This was revised to be a task that 
is encapsulated by other tasks and removed due to the big overlap.
