To run the app from the root folder

## Firstly, install all the dependancies by running this command
bash setup.sh

## Use this command to run the backend and frontend concurrently
npm run dev

## Use this command to run the backend only
npm run start-server

## Use this command to run the frontend only
npm run start-client

TODO in the future: remove secrets in ./backend/config/default.json (put this in .gitignore), not recommended to commit secrets to repo but i guess it's okay for now to make things easier
