Week 1

Had our first project meeting. We delegated roles for writing the project proposal. 
I helped flesh out some user stories started by Matthew and contributed some of my own. 
I also set up JIRA for the project and the google documents to be used for the report. 
I worked out some reasonable dates for the sprints, based on the deadlines throughout 
the term and wrote up the sprint proposal section.

Week 2
I cleaned up the user stories and ensured that all features in the spec were addressed by the user stories. 
I also added acceptance criteria to each user story and started drafting up tentative sub tasks. 

Week 3
I implemented the backend logic for the login endpoint. I also reviewed PRs for backend code from other team members. 
At this point, we have completed user story CAP-6, Account creation for users and have completed the backend for CAP-3, 
Login for users. CAP-4, User dashboard, is pending work from previous endpoints and we have pulled in CAP-12, 
Search for podcast episodes, and CAP-17, Detailed view of podcasts, for the upcoming sprint. Last sprint, we 
may have overestimated our working capabilities. For the upcoming sprint, we have even more tasks but the team 
is confident that we can complete them given that there is more availability in the week. It is good that team 
members are across each otherâ€™s code when reviewing pull requests.
